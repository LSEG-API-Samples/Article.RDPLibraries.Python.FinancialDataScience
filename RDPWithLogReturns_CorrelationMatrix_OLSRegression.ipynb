    "\n",
    "[Refinitiv Data Platform (RDP)](https://developers.refinitiv.com/refinitiv-data-platform). is our cloud-enabled, open platform, that brings together content, analytics, customer and third-party data distribution and management technology in one place.Hence, it would be ideal if a single library could be used to access that content which is in once place as well. That’s why [Refinitiv Data Platform Libraries](https://developers.refinitiv.com/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-platform-libraries) has been built. The libraries make simplify integration into all delivery platforms which are Refinitiv Workspace, or directly to RDP or Elektron. The libraries provide a consistent API experience. You just learn once and apply across the wealth of Refinitiv content. The libraries reach the largest audience of developers possible from Citizen developers to seasoned professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a large standard library including the libraries to analyze data, create beautiful visualizations which reduces length of code to be written significantly. It is also easy leaning. Hence, Python has been included into Refinitiv Data Platform Library. I will demonstrate how easy to use it to access historical data via RDP directly or Refinitiv Workspace. Elektron provides real-time data only so it is out of scope of this article.\n",

    "The RDP Library for Python is on the Function Layer which defines interfaces more suited to scripting languages such as Python. The goal of these interfaces is to allow researchers, data scientists or the casual developer to rapidly prototype solutions within interactive environments such as Jupyter Notebooks.  The Function layer provides simplistic data access in a single function call such as retrieving News Headlines and Stories, retrieving historical intraday, interday data etc.  Because this layer is built on top of the Content layer, it will benefit from convenient abstractions such as preparing data formats suitable for the specific programming language.\n",

Correlation and dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data.

Familiar examples of dependent phenomena include the correlation between the physical statures of parents and their offspring, and the correlation between the price of a good and the quantity the consumers are willing to purchase, as it is depicted in the so-called demand curve."

    "In this article, we have quikly demonstrate how easy it is to retrieve historical data via RDP Libray for Python using get_historical_price_summaries(..) function and calculate Log Returns, Correlation Matrix, and OLS Regression models using Cufflinks which makes financial data visualization convenient. This can be apply to any other models and calculations to serve more accurate or specific use cases."
